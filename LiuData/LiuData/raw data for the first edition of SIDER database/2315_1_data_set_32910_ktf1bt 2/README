FORMAT DESCRIPTION
==================

label_mapping.tsv
-----------------

first two columns: generic and brand names

third column: a marker if the drug could be successfully mapped to STITCH. Possible values:
 - [empty field]: success
 - combination: two or more drugs were combined
 - not found: could not find the name in the database
 - mapping conflict: the available names point to two different compounds
 - template: a package insert that contains information for a group of related drugs

fourth column: STITCH compound id, based on PubChem. Salt forms and stereo-isomers have been merged.

fifth column: URL of the downloaded PDF. This column is empty for FDA SPL labels, which are available in XML.

sixth colum: label identifier



*_adverse_effects.tsv.gz
------------------------

Format: STITCH compound id, UMLS concept id, drug name, side effect name



*_adverse_effects_raw.tsv.gz and *_indications_raw.tsv.gz
---------------------------------------------------------

Medical concepts are extracted both from the adverse effects and the indications sections of the drug labels.
Terms that contain in the indication section are then removed from the adverse effect section. For example,
the indications for an anti-depressant might contain "depression", but also the adverse effect section (e.g.
"in clinical trials to treat depression ..."). To avoid false positives, terms from the indications sections 
are masked. 

Format: label identifier, concept id, name of side effect (as found on the label)


*_freq_parsed.tsv.gz
--------------------

This file contains the frequencies of side effects as extracted from the labels. Format:

- the STITCH compound id
- the source label, if you don't use STITCH compound ids, you can use the label mapping file to 
  find out more about the label
- UMLS concept id
- concept name
- "placebo" if the info comes from placebo administration, "" otherwise
- a description of the frequency: either "postmarketing", "rare", "infrequent", "frequent", or an exact
  percentage
- a lower bound on the frequency
- an upper bound on the frequency

The bounds are ranges like 0.01 to 1 for "frequent". If the exact frequency is known, then the lower bound 
matches the upper bound. Due to the nature of the data, there can be more than one frequency for the same label,
e.g. from different clinical trials or for different levels of severeness.
